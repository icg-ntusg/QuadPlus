# QuadPlus
MATLAB data simulating an over-actuated quadrotor through multiple scenarios such as hover and fixed-attitude hover. : propeller net forces, tilt angles and quadrotor states. 
Here are the scenarios outlined in this repo:

1.) QuadPlus is hovering at 4m altitude with roll and pitch angles of 20 degrees.
2.) QuadPlus is hovering at 4m altitude with a roll angle of 20 degrees.
3.) QuadPlus is hovering at 4m altitude with a roll angle of 20 degrees, experiencing a wind disturbance of 2m/sec.
4.) QuadPlus is hovering at 3m altitude with a roll angle of 20 degrees, experiencing a wind disturbance of 2m/sec.
5.) QuadPlus is following a square trajectory with a roll angle of 20 degrees.
6.) QuadPlus is following a square trajectory with a roll angle of 20 degrees, experiencing a wind disturbance of 2m/sec.
